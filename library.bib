@article{Zigante2011,
abstract = {Choice and competition policies in public services are popular reform strategies in many European countries. Using the case of health care in the UK, this article analyses the effects of choice and competition policies by using subjective well-being (SWB) as an indicator of welfare and equity. Existing literature on welfare effects is focused on measuring efficiency and quality and it is here that SWB offers an alternative perspective. In this article, I use SWB to assess the welfare effects of the choice of hospital policy in the English NHS. Choice preferences are then analysed with a particular focus on the views of different social groups and the results are related to the overall welfare effects of choice with the purpose of capturing equity effects. Results indicate overall positive welfare effects of choice and competition with marked differences between social groups. While it is groups with lower income and lower education that state a higher demand choice, the positive welfare effects I identify are felt most strongly by high income and high education groups. The results highlight the previously debated equity problem arising from choice and competition policies in health care. (JEL codes: D63, I11, I14)},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In this article, we present a simulation study conducted in the emergency department at the University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital. METHODS: Based on analysis of process and flow data, a simulation model of patient throughput in the emergency department has been developed. RESULTS: What-if analyses have been proposed to identify bottlenecks and investigate the optimal numbers of human and equipment resources (eg, nurses, physicians, and radiology technology). The simulation results suggest that 3 additional nurses are needed to ensure desired clinical outcomes. Diagnostic testing, the computed tomography scan in particular, is found to be a bottleneck. As a result, acquisition of an additional computed tomography scanner is recommended. Hospital management has accepted the recommendations, and implementation is in progress. DISCUSSION: Such a model provides a quantitative tool for continuous improvement and process control in the emergency department and also is applicable to other departments in the hospital.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the practice of determining staffing requirements in service systems with random cyclic demands by using a series of stationary queueing models. We consider Markovian models with sinusoidal arrival rates and use numerical methods to show that the commonly used “stationary independent period by period” (SIPP) approach to setting staffing requirements is inaccurate for parameter values corresponding to many real situations. Specifically, using the SIPP approach can result in staffing levels that do not meet specified period by period probability of delay targets during a significant fraction of the cycle. We determine the manner in which the various system parameters affect SIPP reliability and identify domains for which SIPP will be accurate. After exploring several alternatives, we propose two simple modifications of SIPP that will produce reliable staffing levels in models whose parameters span a broad range of practical situations. Our conclusions from the sinusoidal model are tested against some empirical data.},

@article{Miller2006,
abstract = {Purpose – From December 2005, patients in the UK needing an operation will be offered a choice of four or five. These could be NHS trusts, foundation trusts, treatment centres, private hospitals or practitioners with a special interest operating within primary care. This is called “Choose and Book”. The purpose of this research is to discover how critical facilities management service factors are in influencing a choice of hospital. The aim is to find out what the most important influencing factors are to people when making a choice of which hospital to have their operation. If facilities services and the patient environment are influencing factors in the patient experience, which are considered critical. Design/methodology/approach – Focus groups were used as the primary method of data collection. Findings – The study finds that all three focus groups placed more importance on clinical factors than facilities factors. High standards of cleanliness and good hospital food were the two facilities factors that participants in all groups placed most importance on. Cleanliness was highlighted by all three groups as a top facilities priority for the NHS at the moment and there was a general perception that private hospitals have better standards of cleanliness. Practical implications – By understanding how important facilities factors are in influencing patient choice and which ones have a critical impact, it will help NHS trusts focus on where they channel their resources.},

abstract = {In group-living species, decisions made by individuals may result in collective behaviours. A central question in understanding collective behaviours is how individual variation in phenotype affects collective behaviours. However, how the personality of individuals affects collective decisions in groups remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of boldness on the decision-making process in different-sized groups of barnacle geese. Naive barnacle geese, differing in boldness score, were introduced in a labyrinth in groups with either one or three informed demonstrators. The demonstrators possessed information about the route through the labyrinth. In pairs, the probability of choosing a route prior to the informed demonstrator increased with increasing boldness score: bolder individuals decided more often for themselves where to go compared with shyer individuals, whereas shyer individuals waited more often for the demonstrators to decide and followed this information. In groups of four individuals, however, there was no effect of boldness on decision-making, suggesting that individual differences were less important with increasing group size. Our experimental results show that personality is important in collective decisions in pairs of barnacle geese, and suggest that bolder individuals have a greater influence over the outcome of decisions in groups.},

@article{Green2007,
abstract = {We review queueing-theory methods for setting staffing requirements in service systems where customer demand varies in a predictable pattern over the day. Analyzing these systems is not straightforward, because standard queueing theory focuses on the long-run steady-state behavior of stationary models. We show how to adapt stationary queueing models for use in nonstationary environments so that time-dependent performance is captured and staffing requirements can be set. Relatively little modification of straightforward stationary analysis applies in systems where service times are short and the targeted quality of service is high. When service times are moderate and the targeted quality of service is still high, time-lag refinements can improve traditional stationary independent period-by-period and peak-hour approximations. Time-varying infinite-server models help develop refinements, because closed-form expressions exist for their time-dependent behavior. More difficult cases with very long service times and other complicated features, such as end-of-day effects, can often be treated by a modified-offered-load approximation, which is based on an associated infinite-server model. Numerical algorithms and deterministic fluid models are useful when the system is overloaded for an extensive period of time. Our discussion focuses on telephone call centers, but applications to police patrol, banking, and hospital emergency rooms are also mentioned},

@article{Valenzuela2000a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of automated external defibrillators by persons other than paramedics and emergency medical technicians is advocated by the American Heart Association and other organizations. However, there are few data on the outcomes when the devices are used by nonmedical personnel for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: We studied a prospective series of cases of sudden cardiac arrest in casinos. Casino security officers were instructed in the use of automated external defibrillators. The locations where the defibrillators were stored in the casinos were chosen to make possible a target interval of three minutes or less from collapse to the first defibrillation. Our protocol called for a defibrillation first (if feasible), followed by manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary outcome was survival to discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: Automated external defibrillators were used, 105 patients whose initial cardiac rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. Fifty-six of the patients 153 percent) survived to discharge from the hospital. Among the 90 patients whose collapse was witnessed (86 percent), the clinically relevant time intervals were a mean (+/-SD) of 3.5+/-2.9 minutes from collapse to attachment of the defibrillator, 4.4+/-2.9 minutes from collapse to the delivery of the first defibrillation shock, and 9.8+/-4.3 minutes from collapse to The arrival of the paramedics. The survival rate was 74 percent for those who received their first defibrillation no later than three minutes after a witnessed collapse and 49 percent for those who received their first defibrillation after more than three minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid defibrillation by nonmedical personnel using an automated external defibrillator can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. Intervals of no more than three minutes from collapse to defibrillation are necessary to achieve the highest survival rates.},

abstract = {This article presents an agent-based microsimulation capable of forecasting the effects of policy levers that influence individual choices of new passenger cars. The fundamental decision-making units are households distinguished by sociodemographic characteristics and car ownership. A two-stage model of individual decision processes is employed. In the first stage, individual choice sets are constructed using simple, non-compensatory rules that are based on previously owned cars. Second, decision makers evaluate alternatives in their individual choice set using a multi-attributive weighting rule. The attribute weights are based on a multinomial logit model for cross-country policy analysis in European countries. Additionally, prospect theory and the notion of mental accounting are used to model the perception of monetary values. The microsimulation forecasts actual market observations with high accuracy, both on the level of aggregate market characteristics as well as on a highly resolved level of distributions of market shares. The presented approach is useful for the assessment of policies that influence individual purchase decisions of new passenger cars; it allows accounting for a highly resolved car fleet and differentiated consumer segments. As a result, the complexity of incentive schemes can be represented and detailed structural changes can be investigated.},

@article{El-Darzi1998,
abstract = {The flow of patients through geriatric hospitals has been previously described in terms of acute (short-stay), rehabilitation (medium-stay), and long-stay states where the bed occupancy at a census point is modelled by a mixed exponential model using BOMPS (Bed Occupancy Modelling and Planning System). In this a patient is initially admitted to acute care. The majority of the patients are discharged within a few days into their own homes or through death. The rest are converted into medium-stay patients where they could stay for a few months and thereafter either leave the system or move on to a long-stay compartment where they could stay until they die. The model forecasts the average length of stay as well as the average number of patients in each state. The average length of stay in the acute compartment is artificially high if some would-be long-term patients are kept waiting in the short-stay compartment until beds become available in long-stay (residential and nursing homes). In this paper we consider the problem as a queueing system to assess the effect of blockage on the flow of patients in geriatric departments. What-if analysis is used to allow a greater understanding of bed requirements and effective utilisation of resources.},

@article{Storbeck1982,
abstract = {This paper presents a goal programming approach to location covering the contrasts the resultant models with other covering formulations. One of the primary differences between the models forwarded in this paper and those of previous studies is the notion of slack and natural slack in the definition of coverage relations. Our approach takes advantage of the latter concept, natural slack, and produces a location covering form which is more flexible in the determination of objective functions than that of other formulations. Furthermore, we show how the goal programming framework adopted herein allows consideration of a wider range of location covering policy issues.},

@article{Bhaduri2006,
abstract = {There is a popular belief that drug launch is delayed in developing countries like India because of delayed transfer of technology due to a 'post-launch' imitation threat through weak intellectual property rights (IPR). In fact, this belief has been a major reason for the imposition of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights regime under the WTO. This construct undermines the fact that in countries like India, with high reverse engineering capabilities, imitation can occur even before the formal technology transfer, and fails to recognize the first mover advantage in pharmaceutical markets. This paper argues that the first mover advantage is important and will vary across therapeutic areas, especially in developing countries with diverse levels of patient enlightenment and quality awareness. We construct a game theoretic model of incomplete information to examine the delay in drug launch in terms of costs and benefits of first move, assumed to be primarily a function of the therapeutic area of the new drug. Our model shows that drug launch will be delayed only for external (infective/communicable) diseases, while drugs for internal, non-communicable diseases (accounting for the overwhelming majority of new drug discovery) will be launched without delay.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of a study that used discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology to estimate quality weights for a of social care outcome measure. To reflect different states of need, a five-dimensional profile measure was developed. Experimental design techniques were used to derive a sample of states for which preferences were elicited. The DCE approach was employed to elicit values and regression techniques used to estimate a model that could predict index scores for all 243 possible outcomes. The utility model, estimated on the basis of 297 responses, had good test-retest reliability and converged with preferences elicited from a rating exercise.},

The attractiveness of these DC models is that they are embedded in a strong theoretical measurement framework and are based on relatively simple judgmental tasks. The aim of our study was to determine whether the values derived from a DC experiment are comparable to those obtained using other valuation techniques, in particular the time trade-off (TTO).},

@article{Valenzuela2000,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of automated external defibrillators by persons other than paramedics and emergency medical technicians is advocated by the American Heart Association and other organizations. However, there are few data on the outcomes when the devices are used by nonmedical personnel for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: We studied a prospective series of cases of sudden cardiac arrest in casinos. Casino security officers were instructed in the use of automated external defibrillators. The locations where the defibrillators were stored in the casinos were chosen to make possible a target interval of three minutes or less from collapse to the first defibrillation. Our protocol called for a defibrillation first (if feasible), followed by manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary outcome was survival to discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: Automated external defibrillators were used, 105 patients whose initial cardiac rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. Fifty-six of the patients 153 percent) survived to discharge from the hospital. Among the 90 patients whose collapse was witnessed (86 percent), the clinically relevant time intervals were a mean (+/-SD) of 3.5+/-2.9 minutes from collapse to attachment of the defibrillator, 4.4+/-2.9 minutes from collapse to the delivery of the first defibrillation shock, and 9.8+/-4.3 minutes from collapse to The arrival of the paramedics. The survival rate was 74 percent for those who received their first defibrillation no later than three minutes after a witnessed collapse and 49 percent for those who received their first defibrillation after more than three minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid defibrillation by nonmedical personnel using an automated external defibrillator can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. Intervals of no more than three minutes from collapse to defibrillation are necessary to achieve the highest survival rates.},

By extending the model to include waiting beds, we show how the provision of extra, emergency use, unstaffed, back up beds could improve performance while controlling costs. The model is applicable to all lengths of stay, admission rates and bed allocations. The results show why 10-15\% bed emptiness is necessary to maintain service efficiency and demonstrate how unstaffed beds can serve to provide a more responsive and cost effective service. Further work is needed to test the validity and applicability of the model.},

@book{Roughgarden2005,
abstract = {Most of us prefer to commute by the shortest route available, without taking into account the traffic congestion that we cause for others. Many networks, including computer networks, suffer from some type of this "selfish routing." In Selfish Routing and the Price of Anarchy, Tim Roughgarden studies the loss of social welfare caused by selfish, uncoordinated behavior in networks. He quantifies the price of anarchy—the worst-possible loss of social welfare from selfish routing—and also discusses several methods for improving the price of anarchy with centralized control.Roughgarden begins with a relatively nontechnical introduction to selfish routing, describing two important examples that motivate the problems that follow. The first, Pigou's Example, demonstrates that selfish behavior need not generate a socially optimal outcome. The second, the counterintiuitve Braess's Paradox, shows that network improvements can degrade network performance. He then develops techniques for quantifying the price of anarchy (with Pigou's Example playing a central role). Next, he analyzes Braess's Paradox and the computational complexity of detecting it algorithmically, and he describes Stackelberg routing, which improves the price of anarchy using a modest degree of central control. Finally, he defines several open problems that may inspire further research. Roughgarden's work will be of interest not only to researchers and graduate students in theoretical computer science and optimization but also to other computer scientists, as well as to economists, electrical engineers, and mathematicians.},

@phdthesis{Majedi2008,
abstract = {The ambulance offload delay problem is a well-known result of overcrowding and congestion in emergency departments. Offload delay refers to the situation where area hospitals are unable to accept patients from regional ambulances in a timely manner due to lack of staff and bed capacity. The problem of offload delays is not a simple issue to resolve and has caused severe problems to the emergency medical services (EMS) providers, emergency department (ED) staff, and most importantly patients that are transferred to hospitals by ambulance. Except for several reports on the problem, not much research has been done on the subject. Almost all research to date has focused on either EMS or ED planning and operation and as far as we are aware there are no models which have considered the coordination of these units. We propose an analytical model which will allow us to analyze and explore the ambulance offload delay problem. We use queuing theory to construct a system representing the interaction of EMS and ED, and model the behavior of the system as a continuous time Markov chain. The matrix geometric method will be used to numerically compute various system performance measures under different conditions. We analyze the effect of adding more emergency beds in the ED, adding more ambulances, and reducing the ED patient length of stay, on various system performance measures such as the average number of ambulances in offload delay, average time in offload delay, and ambulance and bed utilization. We will show that adding more beds to the ED or reducing ED patient length of stay will have a positive impact on system performance and in particular will decrease the average number of ambulances experiencing offload delay and the average time in offload delay. Also, it will be shown that increasing the number of ambulances will have a negative impact on offload delays and increases the average number of ambulances in offload delay. However, other system performance measures are improved by adding more ambulances to the system. Finally, we will show the tradeoffs between adding more emergency beds, adding more ambulances, and reducing ED patient length of stay. We conclude that the hospital is the bottleneck in the system and in order to reduce ambulance offload delays, either hospital capacity has to be increased or ED patient length of stay is to be reduced.},

@article{Price2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a qualitative study of paramedics' attitudes to pre-hospital thrombolysis (PHT), the government target that emergency calls should receive a response within 8 minutes emerged as a key factor influencing attitudes to staff morale and attitudes to the job as a whole. A study was undertaken to examine paramedics' accounts of the effects on patient care and on their own health and safety of attempts to meet the 8 minute target. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 20 experienced paramedics (16 men) mostly aged 30-50 years with a mean length of service of 19 years. The paramedics were encouraged to raise issues which they themselves considered salient. The interviews were tape recorded, transcribed, and analysed according to the constant comparative method. RESULTS: The paramedics argued that response time targets are inadequate as a performance indicator. They dominate ambulance service culture and practice at the expense of other quality indicators and are vulnerable to "fiddling". The targets can conflict with other quality indicators such as timely administration of PHT and rapid transport of patients to hospital. The strategies introduced to meet the targets can be detrimental to patient care and also have adverse effects on the health, safety, wellbeing, and morale of paramedics. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the 8 minute response time is not evidence based and is putting patients and ambulance crews at risk. There is a need for less simplistic quality indicators which recognise that there are many stages between a patient's call for help and safe arrival in hospital.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of race, geographic distance and quality on the choice of community mental health programs. The study population was comprised of adult Medicaid recipients who received outpatient treatment for serious mental illness in FY 2001. A discrete choice model was employed to examine the likelihood of choosing one program over another. Quality was measured based on follow-up after hospital discharge and continuity of care in outpatient services. Maps showing the relationship between race and the quality of care were prepared to visually confirm the results of the statistical analysis. African American and Hispanic clients were less likely to travel further for treatment, while no significant difference was found between the Caucasian and other race groups. Caucasian subjects were more likely to choose programs with a higher quality of care compared to Hispanic or African American clients. Higher income clients were, on average, traveling longer and receiving better quality of care after controlling for race. The results suggested that clients living in higher income White neighborhoods are more likely to travel longer distances for mental health treatment. Special attention must be paid to improve the quality of care in lower income minority neighborhoods to insure equity of treatment in publicly funded programs.},

A model is presented that can also be used to understand changes in performance that may occur as a result of the 4-hour target regime in the English NHS. The model simulates the performance resulting from normal activity, and the differences between this and actual performance are revealing. The results from two departments are presented to demonstrate this mode of model use. These reveal the extent of special action taken in some emergency departments as patients approach the target time, and also show the true underlying performance of the departments.},

In 2005, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine reported on the important role of simulation as a systems analysis tool that can have an impact on care processes at the care-team, organizational, and environmental levels. Simulation has been widely used to understand causes of ED overcrowding and to test interventions to alleviate its effects. In this paper, we present a systematic review of ED simulation literature from 1970 to 2006 from healthcare, systems engineering, operations research and computer science publication venues. The goals of this review are to highlight the contributions of these simulation studies to our understanding of ED overcrowding and to discuss how simulation can be better used as a tool to address this problem. We found that simulation studies provide important insights into ED overcrowding but they also had major limitations that must be addressed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To present a relatively novel method for modeling length-of-stay data and assess the role of covariates, some of which are related to adverse events. To undertake critical comparisons with alternative models based on the gamma and log-normal distributions. To demonstrate the effect of poorly fitting models on decision-making. METHODS: The model has the process of hospital stay organized into Markov phases/states that describe stay in hospital before discharge to an absorbing state. Admission is via state 1 and discharge from this first state would correspond to a short stay, with transitions to later states corresponding to longer stays. The resulting phase-type probability distributions provide a flexible modeling framework for length-of-stay data which are known to be awkward and difficult to fit to other distributions. RESULTS: The dataset consisted of 1901 patients' lengths of stay and values for a number of covariates. The fitted model comprised six Markov phases, and provided a good fit to the data. Alternative gamma and log-normal models did not fit as well, gave different coefficient estimates, and statistical significance of covariate effects differed between the models. CONCLUSIONS: Models that fit should generally be preferred over those that do not, as they will produce more statistically reliable coefficient estimates. Poor coefficient estimates may mislead decision-makers by either understating or overstating the cost of some event or the cost savings from preventing that event. There is no obvious way of identifying a priori when coefficient estimates from poorly fitting models might be misleading.},

@book{Pigou2001,
abstract = {The Economics of Welfare occupies a privileged position in economics. It contributed to the professionalization of economics, a goal aggressively and effectively pursued by Pigou's predecessor and teacher Alfred Marshall. The Economics of Welfare also may be credited with establishing welfare economics, by systematically analyzing market departures and their potential remedies. In writing The Economics of Welfare, Pigou built a bridge between the old and the new economics at Cambridge and in Britain. Much of the book remains relevant for contemporary economics. The list of his analyses that continues to play an important role in economics is impressive. Some of the more important include: public goods and externalities, welfare criteria, index number problems, price discrimination, the theory of the firm, the structure of relief programs for the poor, and public finance. Pigou's discussion of the institutional structure governing labor-market operations in his Wealth and Welfare prompted Schumpeter to call the work "the greatest venture in labor economics ever undertaken by a man who was primarily a theorist".The Economics of Welfare established welfare economics as a field of study. The first part analyzes the relationship between the national dividend and economic and total welfare. Parts II and III link the size of the dividend to the allocation of resources in the economy and the institutional structure governing labor-market operations. Part IV explores the relationship between the national dividend and its distribution.In her new introduction, Nahid Aslanbeigui discusses the life of Pigou and the history of The Economics of Welfare. She also discusses Pigou's theories asexpressed in this volume and some of the criticisms those theories have met as well as the impact of those criticisms. The Economics of Welfare is a classic that repays careful study.},

@article{Harper2002,
abstract = {The provision of hospital resources, such as beds, operating theatres and nurses, is a matter of considerable public and political concern and has been the subject of widespread debate [1,2,31. The political element of healthcare emphasises the need for objective methods and tools to inform the debate and provide a better foundation for decision-making. There is considerable scope for operational models to be widely used for this purpose. An appreciation of the dynamics governing a hospital system, and the flow of patients through it, point towards the need for sophisticated capacity models reflecting the complexity, uncertainty, variability and limited resources. Working alongside managers and clinicians from participating hospitals, this paper proposes a generic framework for modelling of hospital resources in the light of perceived user-needs and real-life hospital processes. The proposed framework incorporates the need for patient classification techniques to be adopted, which forms a key differentiator between this approach and other attempts to produce practical capacity planning and management tools. Statistically and clinically meaningful patient groupings may then be fed into developed simulation models and individual patients from each group passed through the particular hospital system of concern. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through the development and use of an integrated hospital capacity tool.},

We assume that the sample reflects both the immediate distribution of attribute values from the current decision's context and also the background, real-world distribution of attribute values. DbS accounts for concave utility functions; losses looming larger than gains; hyperbolic temporal discounting; and the overestimation of small probabilities and the underestimation of large probabilities.},

@article{Green2006a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Significant variation in emergency department (ED) patient arrival rates necessitates the adjustment of staffing patterns to optimize the timely care of patients. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a queueing model in identifying provider staffing patterns to reduce the fraction of patients who leave without being seen. METHODS: The authors collected detailed ED arrival data from an urban hospital and used a Lag SIPP queueing analysis to gain insights on how to change provider staffing to decrease the proportion of patients who leave without being seen. The authors then compared this proportion for the same 39-week period before and after the resulting changes. RESULTS: Despite an increase in arrival volume of 1,078 patients (6.3\%), an average increase in provider hours of 12 hours per week (3.1\%) resulted in 258 fewer patients who left without being seen. This represents a decrease in the proportion of patients who left without being seen by 22.9\%. Restricting attention to a four-day subset of the week during which there was no increase in total provider hours, a reallocation of providers based on the queueing model resulted in 161 fewer patients who left without being seen (21.7\%), despite an additional 548 patients (5.5\%) arriving in the second half of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Timely access to a provider is a critical dimension of ED quality performance. In an environment in which EDs are often understaffed, analyses of arrival patterns and the use of queueing models can be extremely useful in identifying the most effective allocation of staff.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Providing choice in health care is part of an ongoing policy initiative. AIM: To explore how people understand choice in healthcare provision. DESIGN OF STUDY: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. SETTING: South East England. METHOD: Twenty-two people were interviewed about the issue of choice in general, and choice in healthcare in particular. Data were analysed using template analysis. RESULTS: Participants discussed choice in the NHS within the context of the GP consultation. Four main themes about choice were identified: positive aspects of choice; the appearance of choice; unwanted choice; and the role of information in choice. Participants valued choice in principle, and having choice was seen as positive. However, the provision of choice options was not always associated with the possibility of meaningful choice. Participants expressed that in some instances they were given the appearance rather than the substance of choice. Making - as opposed to having - choice was often unwanted and considered as indicative of erosion in trust in the GP. Information was seen as a necessary, but not sufficient, prerequisite of informed choice. CONCLUSION: People value having choices rather than making choices but are concerned about choice provision for its own sake rather than choice that is available in a meaningful way. Health care policy that recommends an increase in choice per se may be met with scepticism which could ultimately undermine, rather than promote, the doctor-patient relationship.},

abstract = {Following devolution, differences developed between UK countries in systems of measuring performance against a common target that ambulance services ought to respond to 75\% of calls for what may be immediately life threatening emergencies (category A calls) within 8 minutes. Only in England was this target integral to a ranking system of 'star rating', which inflicted reputational damage on services that failed to hit targets, and only in England has this target been met. In other countries, the target has been missed by such large margins that services would have been publicly reported as failing, if they had been covered by the English system of star ratings. The paper argues that this case-study adds to evidence from comparisons of different systems of hospital performance measurement that, to have an effect, these systems need to be designed to inflict reputational damage on those that have performed poorly; and it explores implications of this hypothesis. The paper also asks questions about the adequacy of systems of performance measurement of ambulance services in UK countries.},

The models are generated by incorporating a survival function into existing covering models.Asurvival function is a monotonically decreasing function of the response time of an emergency medical service (EMS) vehicle to a patient that returns the probability of survival for the patient. The survival function allows for the calculation of tangible outcome measures—the expected number of survivors in case of cardiac arrests. The survival-maximizing location models are better suited for EMS location than the covering models which do not adequately differentiate between consequences of different response times. We demonstrate empirically the superiority of the survival-maximizing models using data from the Edmonton EMS system.},

abstract = {Objective To assess the relationship between daily trauma admissions and observed weather variables, using data from the Trauma Audit and Research Network of England and Wales and the UK Meteorological Office. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting Twenty-one accident and emergency departments (ED) located across England. Participants All patients arriving at one of the selected ED, with a subsequent death, inpatient stay of greater than 3\&emsp14;days, interhospital transfer or requiring critical care between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006. Main Outcome Measures Daily counts of adult and paediatric trauma admissions. Results Multivariate regression analysis indicated that there were strong seasonal trends in paediatric ($\chi$(2) likelihood ratio test p<0.001), and adult (p=0.016) trauma admissions. For adults, each rise of 5°C in the maximum daily temperature and each additional 2\&emsp14;h of sunshine caused increases in trauma admissions of 1.8\% and 1.9\%. Effects in the paediatric group were considerably larger, with similar increases in temperature and hours of sunshine causing increases in trauma admissions of 10\% and 6\%. Each drop of 5°C in the minimum daily temperature, eg, due to a severe night time frost, caused adult trauma admissions to increase by 3.2\%. Also the presence of snow increased adult trauma admissions by 7.9\%. Conclusion This is the largest study of its kind to investigate and quantify the relationship between trauma admissions and the weather. The results show clear associations that have direct application for planning and resource management in UK ED.},

Instead, strategies form Nash equilibria which are often socially suboptimal. Society, therefore, has to pay a price of anarchy for the lack of coordination among its members. Here we assess this price of anarchy by analyzing the travel times in road networks of several major cities. Our simulation shows that uncoordinated drivers possibly waste a considerable amount of their travel time. Counterintuitively, simply blocking certain streets can partially improve the traffic conditions. We analyze various complex networks and discuss the possibility of similar paradoxes in physics.},

By extending the model to include waiting beds, we show how the provision of extra, emergency use, unstaffed, back up beds could improve performance while controlling costs. The model is applicable to all lengths of stay, admission rates and bed allocations. The results show why 10-15\% bed emptiness is necessary to maintain service efficiency and demonstrate how unstaffed beds can serve to provide a more responsive and cost effective service.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a qualitative study of paramedics' attitudes to pre-hospital thrombolysis (PHT), the government target that emergency calls should receive a response within 8 minutes emerged as a key factor influencing attitudes to staff morale and attitudes to the job as a whole. A study was undertaken to examine paramedics' accounts of the effects on patient care and on their own health and safety of attempts to meet the 8 minute target. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 20 experienced paramedics (16 men) mostly aged 30-50 years with a mean length of service of 19 years. The paramedics were encouraged to raise issues which they themselves considered salient. The interviews were tape recorded, transcribed, and analysed according to the constant comparative method. RESULTS: The paramedics argued that response time targets are inadequate as a performance indicator. They dominate ambulance service culture and practice at the expense of other quality indicators and are vulnerable to "fiddling". The targets can conflict with other quality indicators such as timely administration of PHT and rapid transport of patients to hospital. The strategies introduced to meet the targets can be detrimental to patient care and also have adverse effects on the health, safety, wellbeing, and morale of paramedics. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the 8 minute response time is not evidence based and is putting patients and ambulance crews at risk. There is a need for less simplistic quality indicators which recognise that there are many stages between a patient's call for help and safe arrival in hospital.},

abstract = {Following devolution, differences developed between UK countries in systems of measuring performance against a common target that ambulance services ought to respond to 75\% of calls for what may be immediately life threatening emergencies (category A calls) within 8 minutes. Only in England was this target integral to a ranking system of 'star rating', which inflicted reputational damage on services that failed to hit targets, and only in England has this target been met. In other countries, the target has been missed by such large margins that services would have been publicly reported as failing, if they had been covered by the English system of star ratings. The paper argues that this case-study adds to evidence from comparisons of different systems of hospital performance measurement that, to have an effect, these systems need to be designed to inflict reputational damage on those that have performed poorly; and it explores implications of this hypothesis. The paper also asks questions about the adequacy of systems of performance measurement of ambulance services in UK countries.},

abstract = {The ambulance offload delay problem is a well-known result of overcrowding and congestion in emergency departments. Offload delay refers to the situation where area hospitals are unable to accept patients from regional ambulances in a timely manner due to lack of staff and bed capacity. The problem of offload delays is not a simple issue to resolve and has caused severe problems to the emergency medical services (EMS) providers, emergency department (ED) staff, and most importantly patients that are transferred to hospitals by ambulance. Except for several reports on the problem, not much research has been done on the subject. Almost all research to date has focused on either EMS or ED planning and operation and as far as we are aware there are no models which have considered the coordination of these units. We propose an analytical model which will allow us to analyze and explore the ambulance offload delay problem. We use queuing theory to construct a system representing the interaction of EMS and ED, and model the behavior of the system as a continuous time Markov chain. The matrix geometric method will be used to numerically compute various system performance measures under different conditions. We analyze the effect of adding more emergency beds in the ED, adding more ambulances, and reducing the ED patient length of stay, on various system performance measures such as the average number of ambulances in offload delay, average time in offload delay, and ambulance and bed utilization. We will show that adding more beds to the ED or reducing ED patient length of stay will have a positive impact on system performance and in particular will decrease the average number of ambulances experiencing offload delay and the average time in offload delay. Also, it will be shown that increasing the number of ambulances will have a negative impact on offload delays and increases the average number of ambulances in offload delay. However, other system performance measures are improved by adding more ambulances to the system. Finally, we will show the tradeoffs between adding more emergency beds, adding more ambulances, and reducing ED patient length of stay. We conclude that the hospital is the bottleneck in the system and in order to reduce ambulance offload delays, either hospital capacity has to be increased or ED patient length of stay is to be reduced.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Significant variation in emergency department (ED) patient arrival rates necessitates the adjustment of staffing patterns to optimize the timely care of patients. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a queueing model in identifying provider staffing patterns to reduce the fraction of patients who leave without being seen. METHODS: The authors collected detailed ED arrival data from an urban hospital and used a Lag SIPP queueing analysis to gain insights on how to change provider staffing to decrease the proportion of patients who leave without being seen. The authors then compared this proportion for the same 39-week period before and after the resulting changes. RESULTS: Despite an increase in arrival volume of 1,078 patients (6.3\%), an average increase in provider hours of 12 hours per week (3.1\%) resulted in 258 fewer patients who left without being seen. This represents a decrease in the proportion of patients who left without being seen by 22.9\%. Restricting attention to a four-day subset of the week during which there was no increase in total provider hours, a reallocation of providers based on the queueing model resulted in 161 fewer patients who left without being seen (21.7\%), despite an additional 548 patients (5.5\%) arriving in the second half of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Timely access to a provider is a critical dimension of ED quality performance. In an environment in which EDs are often understaffed, analyses of arrival patterns and the use of queueing models can be extremely useful in identifying the most effective allocation of staff.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the practice of determining staffing requirements in service systems with random cyclic demands by using a series of stationary queueing models. We consider Markovian models with sinusoidal arrival rates and use numerical methods to show that the commonly used “stationary independent period by period” (SIPP) approach to setting staffing requirements is inaccurate for parameter values corresponding to many real situations. Specifically, using the SIPP approach can result in staffing levels that do not meet specified period by period probability of delay targets during a significant fraction of the cycle. We determine the manner in which the various system parameters affect SIPP reliability and identify domains for which SIPP will be accurate. After exploring several alternatives, we propose two simple modifications of SIPP that will produce reliable staffing levels in models whose parameters span a broad range of practical situations. Our conclusions from the sinusoidal model are tested against some empirical data.},

abstract = {For each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it, and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the density of the flow. If every driver takes the path that looks most favorable to him, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times.},

@book{Roughgarden2005,
abstract = {Most of us prefer to commute by the shortest route available, without taking into account the traffic congestion that we cause for others. Many networks, including computer networks, suffer from some type of this "selfish routing." In Selfish Routing and the Price of Anarchy, Tim Roughgarden studies the loss of social welfare caused by selfish, uncoordinated behavior in networks. He quantifies the price of anarchy—the worst-possible loss of social welfare from selfish routing—and also discusses several methods for improving the price of anarchy with centralized control.Roughgarden begins with a relatively nontechnical introduction to selfish routing, describing two important examples that motivate the problems that follow. The first, Pigou's Example, demonstrates that selfish behavior need not generate a socially optimal outcome. The second, the counterintiuitve Braess's Paradox, shows that network improvements can degrade network performance. He then develops techniques for quantifying the price of anarchy (with Pigou's Example playing a central role). Next, he analyzes Braess's Paradox and the computational complexity of detecting it algorithmically, and he describes Stackelberg routing, which improves the price of anarchy using a modest degree of central control. Finally, he defines several open problems that may inspire further research. Roughgarden's work will be of interest not only to researchers and graduate students in theoretical computer science and optimization but also to other computer scientists, as well as to economists, electrical engineers, and mathematicians.},

abstract = {The need for effective surgical performance measurement has gained an increasingly high profile in recent years, particularly since events at Bristol Royal Infirmary, where apparent poor performance has prompted the UK Department of Health to instigate a major Public Inquiry. This paper describes issues that concern the measuring and monitoring of surgical performance, and methods that have been devised for judging a good surgeon from the less competent. The authors are a collaborative team composed of specialists in Cardiothoracic surgery and Operational Research analysts with experience of monitoring performance in cardiac surgery. This paper describes concrete examples from that knowledge base.},

@article{Coast1996,
abstract = {The aim of routine utilisation review is to identify patients who are inappropriately placed in an acute unit and who could be alternatively treated in a lower technology facility. Utilisation review was designed as a means of cost control in the USA. but problems with rising emergency admissions and consequent acute bed shortages in the UK have led to a substantial and growing interest in the concept of appropriateness and in the development of utilisation review instruments. Appropriate care is not necessarily the same as efficient care, however, and inappropriate care could potentially be more cost-effective than the alternative. This will depend on, first, whether the design of utilisation review instruments is such that they will encourage efficiency, and second. whether efficiency objectives would be met by the application of utilisation review in the context of the UK health care system. The first issue is discussed in relation to the effectiveness of alternative forms of care. The second is discussed in relation to the potential for reductions in cost, the issue of institutional resistance in the UK, and the validity of utilisation review instruments. The paper concludes that the potential impact of utilisation review on technical efficiency in the UK is ambiguous and questions its purpose in the National Health Service.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model for optimizing admissions to an intensive care unit (ICU) where the objective is to maximize the expected incremental number of lives saved from operating the ICU. The probability distribution of the number of occupied ICU beds is modeled using queueing theory. Three different admissions policies are considered: first come first served (FCFS), first come firstserved for all referrals whose expected incremental survival benefits gained from ICU admission exceed some hurdle (FCFS-H), and first come first served for all referrals whose expected incremental survival benefits exceed a bed specific hurdle (BSH) that depends upon the number of occupied beds (FCFS-BSH). The model is applied to data describing patients referred to the ICU at Jerusalem's Hebrew University-Hadassah Hospital. After statistically estimating the distribution of expected incremental survival benefits among those referred to the ICU, we show that if only those referrals where ICU admission would improve the probability of survival by at least 19.4 percentage points were admitted, an additional 18 statistical lives would be saved annually compared to the FCFS policy, a relative life saving improvement of 17.9\%. Implementing the more complex optimal bed specific hurdle policy would save an additional 1.4 statistical lives annually beyond what can be achieved with FCFS-H, a marginal improvement of only 1.2\%.},

@article{Harper2002b,
abstract = {The provision of hospital resources, such as beds, operating theatres and nurses, is a matter of considerable public and political concern and has been the subject of widespread debate [1,2,31. The political element of healthcare emphasises the need for objective methods and tools to inform the debate and provide a better foundation for decision-making. There is considerable scope for operational models to be widely used for this purpose. An appreciation of the dynamics governing a hospital system, and the flow of patients through it, point towards the need for sophisticated capacity models reflecting the complexity, uncertainty, variability and limited resources. Working alongside managers and clinicians from participating hospitals, this paper proposes a generic framework for modelling of hospital resources in the light of perceived user-needs and real-life hospital processes. The proposed framework incorporates the need for patient classification techniques to be adopted, which forms a key differentiator between this approach and other attempts to produce practical capacity planning and management tools. Statistically and clinically meaningful patient groupings may then be fed into developed simulation models and individual patients from each group passed through the particular hospital system of concern. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through the development and use of an integrated hospital capacity tool.},

The hospital desired an increase in the number of acute coronary-care-unit beds; it also planned to establish an intermediate-care facility so that patients with infarction could be discharged into a unit that provided less care than the acute unit, but more care than the general-hospital beds. Planning required an estimate of the number of beds necessary for both acute and intermediate coronary care.

@article{Harrison2005,
abstract = {A stochastic version of the Harrison-Millard multistage model of the flow of patients through a hospital division is developed in order to model correctly not only the average but also the variability in occupancy levels, since it is the variability that makes planning difficult and high percent occupancy levels increase the risk of frequent overflows. The model is fit to one year of data from the medical division of an acute care hospital in Adelaide, Australia. Admissions can be modeled as a Poisson process with rates varying by day of the week and by season. Methods are developed to use the entire annual occupancy profile to estimate transition rate parameters when admission rates are not constant and to estimate rate parameters that vary by day of the week and by season, which are necessary for the model variability to be as large as in the data. The final model matches well the mean, standard deviation and autocorrelation function of the occupancy data and also six months of data not used to estimate the parameters. Repeated simulations are used to construct percentiles of the daily occupancy distributions and thus identify ranges of normal fluctuations and those that are substantive deviations from the past, and also to investigate the trade-offs between frequency of overflows and the percent occupancy for both fixed and flexible bed allocations. Larger divisions can achieve more efficient occupancy levels than smaller ones with the same frequency of overflows. Seasonal variations are more significant than day-of-the-week variations and variable discharge rates are more significant than variable admission rates in contributing to overflows.},

abstract = {Using real data from a number of hospitals, we predicted the patient flows following a capacity or organisational change. Clinically recognisable patient groups obtained through classification and regression tree analysis were used to tune a simulation model for the flow of patients in critical care units. A tuned model which accurately reflected the base case of the flow of patients was used to predict alterations in service provision in a number of scenarios which included increases in bed numbers, alterations in patients' lengths of stay, fewer delayed discharges, caring for long stay patients outside the formal intensive care unit and amalgamating small units. Where available the predictions' accuracy was checked by comparison with real hospital data collected after an actual capacity change. The model takes variability and uncertainty properly into account and it provides the necessary information for making better decisions about critical care capacity and organisation.},

One such approach is to use simulation to create a 'real world' model of an EU and carry out various tests to gauge ways of improvement. This paper proposes a novel approach in which simulation is used to create a 'perfect world model'. The EU at a major UK hospital is modelled not as it is, but as it could be. The 'efficiency gap' between the 'perfect world' and the 'real world' demonstrates how operational research can be used effectively to identify the location of bottlenecks in the current 'whole hospital' patient pathway and can be used in the planning and managing of hospital resources to ensure the most effective use of those resources.},

abstract = {The U.K. Government has introduced a new class of health service providers called Treatment Centres that provide routine elective services but that do not deal with emergency cases or non-routine elective patients. The introduction of these centres provides a possible mechanism for improving the efficiency of service delivery in terms of overall capacity requirements. In this paper we discuss a mathematical modelling approach that has been used to examine circumstances under which such benefits might be realised. As an illustration of the analysis, we present results obtained using data concerning urological services, for which there would seem to be benefits associated with the introduction of a TC in only a limited range of circumstances.},

@article{Green2003,
abstract = {For many years, average bed occupancy level has been the primary measure that has guided hospital bed capacity decisions at both policy and managerial levels. Even now, the common wisdom that there is an excess of beds nationally has been based on a federal target of 85\% occupancy that was developed about 25 years ago. This paper examines data from New York state and uses queueing analysis to estimate bed unavailability in intensive care units (ICUs) and obstetrics units. Using various patient delay standards, units that appear to have insufficient capacity are identified. The results indicate that as many as 40\% of all obstetrics units and 90\% of ICUs have insufficient capacity to provide an appropriate bed when needed. This contrasts sharply with what would be deduced using standard average occupancy targets. Furthermore, given the model's assumptions, these estimates are likely to be conservative. These findings illustrate that if service quality is deemed important, hospitals need to plan capacity based on standards that reflect the ability to place patients in appropriate beds in a timely fashion rather than on target occupancy levels. Doing so will require the collection and analysis of operational data-such as demands for and use of beds, and patient delays--which generally are not available.},

By extending the model to include waiting beds, we show how the provision of extra, emergency use, unstaffed, back up beds could improve performance while controlling costs. The model is applicable to all lengths of stay, admission rates and bed allocations. The results show why 10-15\% bed emptiness is necessary to maintain service efficiency and demonstrate how unstaffed beds can serve to provide a more responsive and cost effective service. Further work is needed to test the validity and applicability of the model.},

The results of this pilot study indicated that the tool was valid, but reliability has not yet been demonstrated. Thus the tool requires further refinement and testing.

For a target occupancy in excess of 80\%, this simple calculation will typically underestimate the number of beds required. More seriously, it provides no quantitative guidance information about other aspects of critical care demand such as the numbers of emergency patients transferred, deferral rates for elective patients and overall utilisation. The combination of appropriately analysing raw data and detailed mathematical modelling provides a much better method for estimating numbers of beds required. We describe this modelling approach together with evidence of its performance.},

abstract = {The downsizing and closing of state mental health institutions in Philadelphia in the 1990's led to the development of a continuum care network of residential-based services. Although the diversity of care settings increased, congestion in facilities caused many patients to unnecessarily spend extra days in intensive facilities. This study applies a queuing network system with blocking to analyze such congestion processes. "Blocking" denotes situations where patients are turned away from accommodations to which they are referred, and are thus forced to remain in their present facilities until space becomes available. Both mathematical and simulation results are presented and compared. Although queuing models have been used in numerous healthcare studies, the inclusion of blocking is still rare. We found that, in Philadelphia, the shortage of a particular type of facilities may have created "upstream blocking". Thus removal of such facility-specific bottlenecks may be the most efficient way to reduce congestion in the system as a whole.},

This review appraised the comparative safety, effectiveness and costs of new ways of working in critical care. All papers published in peer reviewed journals during 1990-2003 were utilised. A total of 933 potentially relevant papers were identified. Secondary sources including policy papers, and experts within the field were also used to inform this work. Initially 113 papers met the inclusion criteria. However, 58 of these described policy and secular trends in critical care and were therefore used only to provide background information. A total of 55 papers were then critically reviewed to provide academic focus on the subject area. Examples of comparative empirical research on new ways of working were limited, but the review revealed research activity in the areas of: impact of workload; nursing, medical and organisational factors affecting patient outcomes; and methods to support workforce calculations. The findings suggest that research into longer-term patient outcomes is needed together with a proactive and strategic interdisciplinary approach to practice, policy and research.},

@article{Victor2000,
abstract = {Older people (those aged 65 years and over) are the major users of health care services, especially acute hospital beds. Since the creation of the NHS there has been concern that older people inappropriately occupy acute hospital beds when their needs would be best served by other forms of care. Many factors have been associated with delayed discharge (age, sex, multiple pathology, dependency and administrative inefficiencies). However, many of these factors are interrelated (or confounded) and few studies have taken this into account. Using data from a large study of assessment of older patients upon discharge from hospital in England, this paper examines the extent of delayed discharge, and analyses the factors associated with such delays using a conceptual model of individual and organisational factors. Specifically, this paper evaluates the relative contribution of the following factors to the delayed discharge of older people from hospital: predisposing factors (such as age), enabling factors (availability of a family carer), vulnerability factors (dependency and multiple pathology), and organisational/administrative factors (referral for services, type of team undertaking assessments). The study was a retrospective patient case note review in three hospitals in England and included four hundred and fifty-six patients aged 75 years and over admitted from their own homes, and discharged from specialist elderly care wards. Of the 456 patients in the sample, 27\% had a recorded delay in their discharge from hospital of three plus days. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that three factors independently predicted delay in discharge: absence of a family carer, entry to a nursing/residential home, and discharge assessment team staffing. Delayed discharge was not related to the hypothesised vulnerability factors (multiple dependency and multiple pathology) nor to predisposing factors (such as age or whether the older person lived alone). The delayed discharge of older people from hospital is a topic of considerable policy relevance. Our study indicated that delay was independently related to two organisational issues. First, entry into long-term care entailed lengthy assessment procedures, uncertainty over who pays for this care, and waiting lists. Second, the nature of the team assessing people for discharge was associated with delay (the nurse-coordinated team made the fewest referrals for multidisciplinary assessments and had the longest delays). Additionally, the absence of a family carer was implicated in delay, which underlines the importance of family and friends in providing posthospital care and in maintaining older people in the community. Our study suggests that considerable delay in discharging older people from hospital originates from administrative/organisational issues; these were compounded by social services resource constraints. There is still much to be done therefore to improve coordination of care in order to provide a truly 'seamless service'.},

abstract = {Intensive Care (ICU) survivors discharged from ICU to the general ward at night have a higher mortality1,2. We sought to clarify which factors, including night-shift discharge, influence outcome following ICU discharge in a metropolitan hospital, using a cohort study of critically-ill patients between 1/1/1999-30/4/2003. Patients were excluded from analysis if they (a) died in ICU, (b) were transferred to another hospital, (c) had an ICU length of stay <8 hours, or (d) age <16 years. Logistic regression was used to derive a predictive model based on the following variables: patient demographics, severity of illness following ICU admission (APACHE II mortality-risk, pm), final diagnosis, discharge timing including premature or delayed (>4 hours) ICU discharge, and limitation of medical treatment orders. The outcome measures were patient status at hospital discharge and ICU readmission rate. Of the 1870 ICU survivors, 92 (4.9\%) died after discharge from ICU. Patients discharged to the ward during the night-shift (2200-0730 hours) had a higher APACHE II score and crude mortality. The difference in APACHE II pm did not reach statistical significance. No significant calendar or seasonal pattern was identified. Logistic regression identified night-shift discharge (RR=1.7; 95\% CI 1.03-2.9; P=0.03), limited medical treatment order (RR=5.1; 95\% CI 2.2-12) and admission APACHE II pm (RR=3.3; 95\% CI 1.3-7.6) as independent predictors of patient outcome following ICU transfer to the ward. Conclusion: At the time of ICU discharge to the ward three factors are predictive of hospital outcome: timing of ICU discharge, limited medical treatment orders and initial illness severity.},

abstract = {In hospitals, patients can be rejected at both the operating theater (OT) and the intensive care unit (ICU) due to limited ICU capacity. The corresponding ICU rejection probability is an important service factor for hospitals. Rejection of an ICU request may lead to health deterioration for patients, and for hospitals to costly actions and a loss of precious capacity when an operation is canceled. There is no simple expression available for this ICU rejection probability that takes the interaction with the OT into account. With c the ICU capacity (number of ICU beds), this paper proves and numerically illustrates a lower bound by an M|G|c|c system and an upper bound by an M|G|c-1|c-1 system, hence by simple Erlang loss expressions. The result is based on a product form modification for a special OT–ICU tandem formulation and proved by a technically complicated Markov reward comparison approach. The upper bound result is of particular practical interest for dimensioning an ICU to secure a prespecified service quality. The numerical results include a case study.},

One method of predicting intensive care bed needs creates a mathematical model of the unit which simulates the unit's operation. This report describes a model that provided information to a physician group charge with deciding how many beds to include in a proposed expansion of one hospital's ICU. As the total number of beds in the simulated unit increased from 7 to 15, the model predicted a linear increase in the number of empty beds and a nonlinear decrease in the number of prematurely discharged patients. Based on the results, the group chose to leave the unit's size unchanged at 11 beds. The immediate result was to facilitate planning by providing quantitative estimates of the consequences of different choices. The long-term result was an ICU whose size accommodated patient needs despite changing demand for services.},

Only in England was this target integral to a ranking system of 'star rating', which inflicted reputational damage on services that failed to hit targets, and only in England has this target been met. In other countries, the target has been missed by such large margins that services would have been publicly reported as failing, if they had been covered by the English system of star ratings. The paper argues that this case-study adds to evidence from comparisons of different systems of hospital performance measurement that, to have an effect, these systems need to be designed to inflict reputational damage on those that have performed poorly; and it explores implications of this hypothesis. The paper also asks questions about the adequacy of systems of performance measurement of ambulance services in UK countries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Significant variation in emergency department (ED) patient arrival rates necessitates the adjustment of staffing patterns to optimize the timely care of patients. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a queueing model in identifying provider staffing patterns to reduce the fraction of patients who leave without being seen. METHODS: The authors collected detailed ED arrival data from an urban hospital and used a Lag SIPP queueing analysis to gain insights on how to change provider staffing to decrease the proportion of patients who leave without being seen. The authors then compared this proportion for the same 39-week period before and after the resulting changes. RESULTS: Despite an increase in arrival volume of 1,078 patients (6.3\%), an average increase in provider hours of 12 hours per week (3.1\%) resulted in 258 fewer patients who left without being seen. This represents a decrease in the proportion of patients who left without being seen by 22.9\%. Restricting attention to a four-day subset of the week during which there was no increase in total provider hours, a reallocation of providers based on the queueing model resulted in 161 fewer patients who left without being seen (21.7\%), despite an additional 548 patients (5.5\%) arriving in the second half of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Timely access to a provider is a critical dimension of ED quality performance. In an environment in which EDs are often understaffed, analyses of arrival patterns and the use of queueing models can be extremely useful in identifying the most effective allocation of staff.},

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for estimating a health purchaser's WTP for health in markets where the health purchaser offers a menu of medical interventions, and each individual in the population selects the intervention that maximizes her prospect. We discuss how the WTP for health can be employed to determine medical guidelines, and to price new medical technologies, such that the health purchaser is willing to implement them. The framework further introduces a measure for WTP for expansion, defined as the amount of money the health purchaser is willing to pay per person in the population served by the health provider to increase the consumption level of the intervention by one percent without changing the intervention price. This measure can be employed to find how much to invest in expanding a medical program through opening new facilities, advertising, etc. Applying the proposed framework to colorectal cancer screening tests, we estimate the WTP for health and the WTP for expansion of colorectal cancer screening tests for the 2005 US population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To present a relatively novel method for modeling length-of-stay data and assess the role of covariates, some of which are related to adverse events. To undertake critical comparisons with alternative models based on the gamma and log-normal distributions. To demonstrate the effect of poorly fitting models on decision-making. METHODS: The model has the process of hospital stay organized into Markov phases/states that describe stay in hospital before discharge to an absorbing state. Admission is via state 1 and discharge from this first state would correspond to a short stay, with transitions to later states corresponding to longer stays. The resulting phase-type probability distributions provide a flexible modeling framework for length-of-stay data which are known to be awkward and difficult to fit to other distributions. RESULTS: The dataset consisted of 1901 patients' lengths of stay and values for a number of covariates. The fitted model comprised six Markov phases, and provided a good fit to the data. Alternative gamma and log-normal models did not fit as well, gave different coefficient estimates, and statistical significance of covariate effects differed between the models. CONCLUSIONS: Models that fit should generally be preferred over those that do not, as they will produce more statistically reliable coefficient estimates. Poor coefficient estimates may mislead decision-makers by either understating or overstating the cost of some event or the cost savings from preventing that event. There is no obvious way of identifying a priori when coefficient estimates from poorly fitting models might be misleading.},

abstract = {The provision of hospital resources, such as beds, operating theatres and nurses, is a matter of considerable public and political concern and has been the subject of widespread debate [1,2,31. The political element of healthcare emphasises the need for objective methods and tools to inform the debate and provide a better foundation for decision-making. There is considerable scope for operational models to be widely used for this purpose. An appreciation of the dynamics governing a hospital system, and the flow of patients through it, point towards the need for sophisticated capacity models reflecting the complexity, uncertainty, variability and limited resources. Working alongside managers and clinicians from participating hospitals, this paper proposes a generic framework for modelling of hospital resources in the light of perceived user-needs and real-life hospital processes. The proposed framework incorporates the need for patient classification techniques to be adopted, which forms a key differentiator between this approach and other attempts to produce practical capacity planning and management tools. Statistically and clinically meaningful patient groupings may then be fed into developed simulation models and individual patients from each group passed through the particular hospital system of concern. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through the development and use of an integrated hospital capacity tool.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of race, geographic distance and quality on the choice of community mental health programs. The study population was comprised of adult Medicaid recipients who received outpatient treatment for serious mental illness in FY 2001. A discrete choice model was employed to examine the likelihood of choosing one program over another. Quality was measured based on follow-up after hospital discharge and continuity of care in outpatient services. Maps showing the relationship between race and the quality of care were prepared to visually confirm the results of the statistical analysis. African American and Hispanic clients were less likely to travel further for treatment, while no significant difference was found between the Caucasian and other race groups. Caucasian subjects were more likely to choose programs with a higher quality of care compared to Hispanic or African American clients. Higher income clients were, on average, traveling longer and receiving better quality of care after controlling for race. The results suggested that clients living in higher income White neighborhoods are more likely to travel longer distances for mental health treatment. Special attention must be paid to improve the quality of care in lower income minority neighborhoods to insure equity of treatment in publicly funded programs.},
